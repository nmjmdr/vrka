 Process Id related assumptions:
 the assumption here is that process ids will not execced int16
 that is max: 65535
 but they can, check: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/02/05/10495426.aspx

 code might generate overallping process ids, if process ids get larger than: 65535
 also it is assumed that process ids cannot be negative
