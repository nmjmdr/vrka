Other notes:
three scnearios, applicable in candidate state
	 1. Majority votes received, elected as leader
	 2. Received another Append entries (heartbeat) with higher or equal term, becomea follower
	 3. Election timeout - nobody elected as leader


	when sending requests there are these cases:
	1. The node obtains majority of votes -> transitions to a leader
	2. The node does not obtain a majority of votes -> other followers have already voted, but yet to receive heartbeats
	      - the candidate will eventually receive the heartbeat and become a follower
	3. The node does not obtain a majority of votes -> other followers have already voted, have already received a heartbeat
	      - the candidate will eventually receive the heartbeat and become a follower
	4. Nobody get elected, votes split
	      - will timeout on  election notice
	5. No responses obtained timeout, may be the network was broken midway, the candidate got disconnected from network
	     - timeout on election notice
